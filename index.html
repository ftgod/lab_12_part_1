	<li>We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</li> 
</ol> 
<h5>A Clockwork Origin</h5> 
<p>Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. I can explain. It's very valuable. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Bender, we're trying our best.</p>
